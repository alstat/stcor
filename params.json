{"name":"stcor: Correlograms of Space-Time ARIMA","tagline":"r, arima, space-time, time series, package","body":"Description\r\n=====\r\nThe `stcor` package provides functions for correlograms of the advanced time series model, the Space-Time Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (STARIMA). These functions are the Space-Time Autocorrelation Function (`stacf`) and Space-Time Partial Autocorrelation Function (`stpacf`). Including function for centralizing (`stcenter`) the data to its mean.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n-----\r\n```{coffee}\r\nif (!require(\"devtools\"))\r\n  install.packages(\"devtools\")\r\ndevtools::install_github(\"stcor\", \"alstat\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n***\r\nVignette\r\n-----\r\nTo start with, let us simulate a space-time series. Assuming there are seven (7) spatial locations with 200 observation. Then we have,\r\n```{coffee}\r\nseries <- arima.sim(list(order = c(2,0,0),\r\n                    ar = c(0.7, -0.5)), n = 155)\r\n\r\nlocation1 <- series + rnorm(length(series))\r\nlocation2 <- series + rnorm(length(series))\r\nlocation3 <- series + rnorm(length(series))\r\nlocation4 <- series + rnorm(length(series))\r\nlocation5 <- series + rnorm(length(series))\r\nlocation6 <- series + rnorm(length(series))\r\nlocation7 <- series + rnorm(length(series))\r\n```\r\nNow we will merge this into a data frame object,\r\n```{coffee}\r\nseries.df <- data.frame(location1, location2, location3,\r\n                        location4, location5, location6,\r\n                        location7)\r\n```\r\nAnd it is required to centralize the data to its mean,\r\n```{coffee}\r\nseries.df <- stcenter(series.df)\r\n```\r\nThen assuming the spatial neighbourhood of our data has the following weights matrices,\r\n\r\n* Weights matrix for first spatial order\r\n\r\n```{coffee}\r\nW1 <- rbind(c(0,0,0,0,0,1,0),\r\n            c(0,0,0,1,0,0,0),\r\n            c(0,0,0,1,0,0,0),\r\n            c(0,1/3,1/3,0,0,1/3,0),\r\n            c(0,0,0,0,0,1/2,1/2),\r\n            c(1/4,0,0,1/4,1/4,0,1/4),\r\n            c(0,0,0,0,1/2,1/2,0))\r\n```\r\n* Weights matrix for second spatial order\r\n\r\n```{coffee}\r\nW2 <- rbind(c(0,0,1/3,1/3,0,0,1/3),\r\n            c(0,0,1/2,0,0,1/2,0),\r\n            c(1/3,1/3,0,0,0,1/3,0),\r\n            c(1/3,0,0,0,1/3,0,1/3),\r\n            c(0,0,0,1,0,0,0),\r\n            c(0,1/2,1/2,0,0,0,0),\r\n            c(1/2,0,0,1/2,0,0,0))\r\n```\r\n* Weights matrix for third spatial order\r\n\r\n```{coffee}\r\nW3 <- rbind(c(0,1/2,0,0,1/2,0,0),\r\n            c(1/3,0,0,0,1/3,0,1/3),\r\n            c(0,0,0,0,1/2,0,1/2),\r\n            c(0,0,0,0,0,0,0),\r\n            c(1/3,1/3,1/3,0,0,0,0),\r\n            c(0,0,0,0,0,0,0),\r\n            c(0,1/2,1/2,0,0,0,0))\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally we compute the STACF and STPACF\r\n```{coffee}\r\nstacf(data = series.df, wmatrices = list(NULL, W1, W2, W3))\r\nstpacf(data = series.df, wmatrices = list(NULL, W1, W2, W3))\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
